## Intro

This program is a compound interest calculator for the command line.

The following formula is used to calculate the interest:
$$A=P(1+{r/n})^{nt}$$
Where...
- *A* is the total amount after interest is generated
- *P* is the principal amount before interest is generated
- *r* is the nominal annual interest rate
- *n* is the compounding frequency
- *t* is the length of time interest is applied
